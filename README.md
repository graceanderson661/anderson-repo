My soundscape is supposed to be about a hectic shift at a restaurant. I wanted it to start and end with the sound of the computer clocking you in and printing your slip. I recorded most of these sounds at work, which is already loud and busy. I added a couple of sounds, like plates breaking and ears ringing, to add to the storyâ€™s chaos. The restaurant owner talks a lot, especially when the restaurant is busy, which is overwhelming, so his voice is featured frequently. I overlapped some sounds and added the reverb effect to create the feeling that you are in a trance and only break out of it when the shift is over.
